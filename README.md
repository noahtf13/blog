# My Personal Blog
This is my attempt at creating my blog from somewhat scratch with Hugo and the hugo-bearblog template.

# /content
Contains the home page `_index.md` as well as the `/content/blog` subdirectory that houses my blog posts.

# /static
Contains all images live including the favicon for the site

# /themes
Contains `/themes/hugo-bearblog` which is the theme I use for my blog. 

# config.toml
Where all the hugo configurations live.
