# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Noah

My [day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-t-ford/) involves creating stories with data at Onaroll [(we're hiring by the way)](https://jobs.lever.co/onaroll) but my goal with this blog is to showcase my projects and writing that I pursue out of love for creating something new. I love to use data to tell a story about [really any topic](http://noah-ford.com/predicting-your-neighborhood-election-results-based-on-cracker-barrel-and-whole-foods-proximity/). 

I'd love to hear from you at noahtylerford@gmail.com or at [insert calendly link here].
