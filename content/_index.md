# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Noah

My [day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-t-ford/) involves creating stories with data at Onaroll [(we're hiring by the way)](https://jobs.lever.co/onaroll) but my goal with this blog is to showcase my projects and writing that I pursue out of love for creating something new. I love to use data to tell a story about [really any topic](https://noah-ford.com/cracker-barrel-whole-foods-presidential-2020/). 

I'd love to hear from you at noahtylerford@gmail.com or at my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/noah_ford/30-minute-meeting).
