# What's with the icon?

It's a [_Epipremnum aureum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipremnum_aureum), but I call it a Pothos or Devil's Ivy. It is **easily** my favorite plant due to its simple beauty and how hard it is to kill! My favorite part is that grows in water just as well as in soil with very little light.
