The other day, on a regular virtual lunch that I irregularly show up to, a previous colleague of mine called me a "sponge" in the sense that I pick things up easily. They stated they were trying to hire a sponge of their own, and I thought the answer to that question would work nicely for a blog!

I was warmed by the compliment from a former colleague that I respect and look up to, but it does make me a bit uneasy that I have/get to pat myself on the back in this blog. 

# What  or Who The Heck is a Sponge?
Just because someone can pick things up quickly, doesn't mean they can ace your interview that doesn't involve real world questions[^1].  A sponge comes to the conclusion that they know they do not know something, doesn't get bogged down by this fact, and figures out where to point their compass so they can fill their missing piece of knowledge quickly.

## Using Git as an Example
As a Data Scientist Git can be scary, in many DS roles it isn't _required_ or as commonly in use as for a Software Engineer (SWE). It is obviously good best practice to utilize it, even just for code that you don't want to lose, but especially for models and analysis that will be used in a production enviornment. 

| SWE Skills[^2]          | DS Skills[^3]        |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Software Engineering | Machine Learning |
| JavaScript           | SQL              |
| Java                 | Python           |
| HTML                 | Analysis         |
| SQL                  | Data Analytics   |
| Git                  | Tableau          |
| Database             | Statistics       |
| Python               | Database         |
| MySQL                | Technical        |
| Computer Science     | Data Mining      |

Alas, two years into my DS career, I had never even typed `git init` once. As the most juinor DS on my team, it just felt like another con to having me around. At the same time I knew it needed to be addressed. 

### Diving In
The same colleague I mentioned before was gracious enough to sit down with me and explain to me with branch like diagrams and why I maybe shouldn't `git clone` a repo every time I use it ðŸ˜….
