Habits have had their day in pop culture, [_Atomic Habits_](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292), James Clear's bestselling pop psych book that bills itself as "An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones" topped Amazon's Most Sold List for 31 weeks[^1]. Before James Clear's smash hit was another immensely popular book [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://bookshop.org/books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-30th-anniversary-edition-anniversary/9781982137274), claiming it has "...transformed the lives of presidents and CEOs, educators and parents...". 

It is clear that both books aim to point the finger say "if it works for Barack it will work for you". For me, it wasn't that both of these didn't have some good material but both made it seem that they were the last stop of on the habit journey, but if millions have read each, then why have so many missed the destination of success? 

Now I have read and even enjoyed both, it was clear that I was looking to step up my habit game. The problem I had with each is instead of "hey maybe try this out", it was more of "you just need to believe in the system". I'm sure they each influenced my journey to a system I love today, but I think it is important to acknowledge they are just two people's opinions.

# My Habits and "System"
I wrap system in quotes to help the reader understand that system may be too heavy of a word. It's my system today but I won't be surprised when it inevitably changes.
