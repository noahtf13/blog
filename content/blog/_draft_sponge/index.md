The other day, on a regular virtual lunch that I irregularly show up to, a previous colleague of mine called me a "sponge" in the sense that I pick things up easily. They stated they were trying to hire a sponge of their own, and I thought the answer to that question would work nicely for a blog!

I was warmed by the compliment from a former colleague that I and look up to, but it does make me a bit uneasy that I have/get to pat myself on the back in this blog. 

# What or Who The Heck is a Sponge?
Just because someone can pick things up quickly, doesn't mean they can ace your interview that doesn't involve real world questions[^1].  A sponge comes to the conclusion that they know they do not know something, doesn't get bogged down by this fact, and figures out where to point their compass so they can fill their missing piece of knowledge quickly.
## Git as an Example
As a Data Scientist Git can be scary, in many DS roles it isn't _required_ or as used as much as in the Software Engineer (SWE) profession. It is still best practice to utilize it, even just for code that you don't want to lose, but especially for models and analysis that will be used in a production enviornment.

Alas, two years into my DS career, I had never even typed `git init` once, that might sound crazy to someone who is a Software Engineer but it is not so crazy among Data Scientists given the table above. As the most juinor DS on my team, it just felt like another con to having me around. At the same time I knew it needed to be addressed. 

### Diving In
The same colleague I mentioned before was gracious enough to sit down with me and explain to me with branch like diagrams and why I maybe shouldn't `git clone` a repo every time I use it ðŸ˜….

These are obviously embarassing moments when you "should" know something. Many times we have a vision that a Senior DS has 5 years of ML, BI, Git, deploying models, and all the other skills a DS "should" have. This vision is toxic since it causes us to hide our gaps instead of getting excited to fill them. 

Weathering the 30 minutes of intro to Git from a more Senior colleague was the key to learning what I didn't know. Without this intro I would not have known where to start and I did not even  have the terminology that [Google Fu](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/19973) could fix. I thought I was being prudent by not keeping our top-secret code on my machine, sometimes you need someone to tell you how to dig out  of a hole. 

### Leveraging Your Knowledge of the Unknown 
This is the moment where you show if you are a sponge or not. At this point I knew that rebasing, `--amend` , forks, and branches were important and that was enough to kickstart my journey. There is not a need for my colleague to continue spending their precious time 1-on-1 teaching when there are 60M results to the query "What is a fork git?". I knew there were holes and gaps in my git knowledge but now I knew **where** exactly the holes and gaps were located, and more holes would lead to a worm farm of other adventures and gaps!
