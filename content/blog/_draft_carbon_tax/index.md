# The Good and the Bad

With the [August 16th, 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text), this much is clear:

- The *Inflation Reduction Act* will very likely reduce emissions
  - [By around 40% compared to 2005 levels](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/8.18%20InflationReductionAct_Factsheet_Final.pdf)
- Targets from the Paris Climate agreement have a very low chance of being hit 
  - [Around a 1 in 1000 chance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00524-4)
- Legislation can always be repealed 
  - [Up to 6 times in a single Congress](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/10/16/understanding-when-and-why-congress-repeals-laws-is-as-important-as-looking-at-how-it-makes-them/#Author)
- We are far from caring about the earth "too much" anytime soon
  - [9% of Republicans and 68% of Democrats saw it as "very important" for the 2022 midterms](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/03/key-facts-about-u-s-voter-priorities-ahead-of-the-2022-midterm-elections/ft_2022-11-03_election-roundup_01/)

To summarize: The sky isn't falling, yet it is going to get warmer than we would like, **but we can change by how much**. 

# *How* Do We Affect Change?
Among the best tool in the toolbox is
## Carbon Tax
I believe the free market does an efficient[^1] job a pricing things when there are no [externalities](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/externality).  

> \[C]onsequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other people or things without this being reflected in market prices
>
>  \- Externality

Polluting a river, likely does not affect the hog farmer who produces the meat or the butcher they sell to, as both parties are figuratively and literally upstream from the pollution. 

To solve for this effect, we need to understand the social cost of the hog farmer's actions and charge him properly. This way the cost of the farmer producing pork will be:

$C = C_b + C_s$, where: 
- $C$, the total cost to the farmer and the sum of:
  - $C_b$, the cost of business:
    - Feed
    - Tractor
    - Barn
  - $C_s$, the social costs (or externalities):
    - Declining quality of drinking water
      - City has to increase filtration resources
    - Harm to fish in the water and possibly a food source
    - Inability for citizens downstream to enjoy the river recrationally

The farmer would take on the *true* cost of their pork (and waste) production, and pass the costs on to the butcher who passes them to the bacon buyer. This would mean higher bacon costs. With higher bacon costs, foods with low externalities would become relatively cheaper, pushing shoppers towards goods that have a lower cost to others.

<mark>To Do</mark>:
- We all love checks
  - Talk about dividends

With carbon taxing we are taxing CO2 emissions and not just river pollution but it works the same way.

### Who Does the Taxing?

Well, no one else has the authority to carry this out besides the government you pay taxes to. Your neighbor trying to tax you for externalities wouldn't work too well. 

Some governments already have carbon taxes, but [they are too low, according to the International Monetary Fund:](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/07/21/blog-more-countries-are-pricing-carbon-but-emissions-are-still-too-cheap)

> To limit global warming, coverage must expand while prices rise from a global average of \\$6 per ton of CO2 today to \\$75 by 2030.

To Do:
- Well how do I carbon tax myself without a government doing so?
- Who will make sure the carbon tax is implemented?
- How I can support these people? 

[^1]: Whether or not the free market is the *best* way to price goods and services is outside of the thesis I'm putting forward.
