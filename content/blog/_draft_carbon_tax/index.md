# What do you mean "carbon tax yourself"?
Making a donation to a climate-focused organization based on an estimate of your 2022 pollution (CO2 emissions). 

# Why?

Some governments already have carbon taxes, but [they are too low, according to the International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/07/21/blog-more-countries-are-pricing-carbon-but-emissions-are-still-too-cheap):

>Despite the proliferation of carbon pricing schemes, policymakers should do more. To limit global warming, coverage must expand while prices rise from a global average of \\$6 per ton of CO2Â today to \\$75 by 2030.

So while a bill like the Inflation Reduction Act *should* be celebrated for its accomplishments [since  it will likely have a positive effect on climate change](https://www.wri.org/update/brief-summary-climate-and-energy-provisions-inflation-reduction-act-2022), there is *clearly* more work to be done.

>Under a business-as-usual scenario (without the IRA), the U.S. would be expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by between 24% and 35% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This reduction is a far cry from the 50-52% reduction target set in the latest U.S. nationally determined contribution (NDC). With the passage of the IRA, GHG reductions are expected to reach 31% to 44% by 2030.


# How?
## 1. Fill out this [3-minute survery by CarboTax](http://carbotax.org/) and make note of the final number
I tested it, and it only took 3 minutes and 15 seconds!

## 2. Pick a social cost of carbon
Even when a nation puts a price on carbon it is often too low compared to the true [externalities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/externality.asp) caused by pollution, often called the [social cost of carbon](https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/social-cost-carbon-101/). 
### Some Options
| Estimate                  | Cost per Metric Ton | Source                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Previous Federal Estimate | $51               | [Energy Wire](https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-floats-sharply-increased-social-cost-of-carbon/#:~:text=That%20document%20estimates%20the%20social,future%20impacts%20of%20climate%20change.) |
| EPA's New Proposal        | $190              | [Energy Wire](https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-floats-sharply-increased-social-cost-of-carbon/#:~:text=That%20document%20estimates%20the%20social,future%20impacts%20of%20climate%20change.) |
| RFF + UC Berkely          | \\$44-413 ("Preferred Mean": \\$185)          | [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05224-9)                                                                                                                                    |

The ranges clearly vary greatly but most of us are likely at $0 currently. Picking any of these or another number, whether it ends up being the most accurate one, is a large step in the right diection.
## 3. Optional: If applicable, subtract your state's current price on carbon
[Twelve states have some sort of carbon pricing](https://www.c2es.org/document/us-state-carbon-pricing-policies/#:~:text=Those%20states%20are%20California%20and,Greenhouse%20Gas%20Initiative%20(RGGI).) but it can be difficult to discern what the price on carbon is, especially with states that use cap and trade instead of a true carbon tax. I was unable to find a reliable source that provided state-by-state prices on carbon. 
## 4. Calculate your tax from the previous year
1. Your answer from the survery (your emissions, tCO2), multipled by:
2. The social cost you chose
	1. Subtracting your states price on carbon if you so chose

Put differently:
$$ tax = CO_2 * (CO2_{social} - CO2_{state})$$
where:

- $CO_2$: Emissions from step #1 
- $CO2_{social}$: Cost from step #2
- $CO2_{state}$: Cost from step #3 
## 5. Where to donate the "tax"?
