I recently moved my _one_ post to a blog that was more custom and managed by me using Hugo + the bear blog theme instead of the very awesome and easy-to-use platform Hashnode.  This isn't a tutorial of how I moved from Hashnode but more of my thoughts on why I did it for three bad reasons. 

# What are Hashnode, Bear Blog, and Hugo?
## Hashnode
## Bear Blog
## Hugo 

# Why Move Off Hashnode? Why Hugo? Why Not Bear Blog?
Three sketchy reasons:

## 1. I am Addicted to Finding the Next Best Tool

Even though I never blog to begin with. I now will have had 2 posts over the course of having 2 methods of blogging. I cannot reccomend this less, and bloggers and writers I respect have made it clear that you should write every day or often before worrying about where your writing lives - if it lives anywhere outside of a notebook - and how it looks. 

I obviously avoided this advice, to me I hadn't engaged with a completely new tool in awihle - either at work or outside of it - and was yearning for the aha moment of hitting deploy and watching something _I_ built actually work! 

-> Why Hugo is the best 

## 2. Improve Web Dev Experience
Hashnode is too easy, you can have a blog in a couple minutes and it looks good out of the box. Your blog also gets posted to Hashnode's feed. It was too easy on me and thus didn't teach me anything at all.

My day to day work is as a Data Scientist and I have gotten over the imposter syndrome in that profession but not in adjacent disciplines of programming, even as I write Python and/or SQL every weekday I don't see myself as a programmer. I feel that this is a common refrain from many Data Scientists that I've worked with and I've always wanted to get to the point of considering myself a somewhat employable software engineer.

> Data Scientists must be a better statistican than a programmar and a better programmar than a statisician. 

To be clear I don't think that getting a simple static site up and running will make me a better Data Scientist directly, but I do think it can be an indirect benefit by teaching me that entering the space of the unkown can be enjoyable and gratifying. Hugo isn't hard to setup but it isn't easier than Hashnode, Medium, or Substack when it comes to setting up a blog. For me it was perfect middle between hosting my own site on a Raspberry Pi (I'm using Netlify) and Medium or Substack. 

## 3. I liked the look and speed of Bearblog but "needed" to have the blog powered by git and not another platform
-> What is Bear Blog

This is the weirdest of the three reasons. Due to the insecurity I ooze when my programming hat is on, I felt that for my blog to be legit it needed to be powered by a repository. It's nice that this keeps my git skills fresh since I don't or can't always use git in my day-to-day work. I could have a repo that houses all the queries I've put into Metabase but it isn't neccesary in order for the queries to run as opposed to someone creating production software. 

Hashnode has the ability to connect a repo but in my opinion the reason you use Hashnode is to setup a blog in 5 minutes, so using a repo seems to go against the very reason to be on that platform. 

# Parting Thoughts
If it isnt clear from the post, I think Hashnode is the better dev-blog platform for most people since it is so simple. 

This was more or less to reassure myself that it can be worthwhile to do things without a solid reason. I recently had 10 days off work and this fufilled my craving to get back to something that was somewhat challenging, very rewarding, and totally unnecessary!

I'd love to hear from you at noahtylerford+blog@gmail.com and thanks for making it all the way through!
